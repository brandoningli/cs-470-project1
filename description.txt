In client-server mode, a list of IP addresses are provided with server
priority from top to bottom. The designated "server" sends a summary packet
containing all known clients heartbeats including its own. This server is
designated with a set flag. Once the server dies, the next client on the IP
list knows to become the new server because it stops receiving the summary
packet. Every client waits from 0 to 30 seconds and then they send their
heartbeat to the server. Every client has a 30 second TTL while the current
server has a TTL of 90 seconds.

In peer-to-peer mode, every client just sends their heartbeat packet to every
other client in the list of IP addresses. Again, this is done every 0 to 30
seconds. After 30 seconds of not receiving a packet from another client the
given client is considered dead.
